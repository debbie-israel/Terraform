- Terraform allows you to write infrastructure as code:
  - In other words you can either go into the web console and you can just start launching some new instances manually
  - or you can do that in code, using Terraform.
- It's the automation of your infrastructure:
  - Terraform keeps your infrastructure in certain states,
  - It keeps compliant, makes your infrastructure auditable.
  - Think about a AWS, DigitalOcean, the Azure everything that has an API.
